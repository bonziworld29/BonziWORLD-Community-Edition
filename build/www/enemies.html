      <!-- like the dangers of bonziworld, but a bit more simplified !--->
      <!-- some todos: maybe add some bonziworld css? idk but i guess that happens on some important pages. !--->
      Fune and his zombies (The motherfucker responsible for bonzi.lol. Read more about him on our callout doc.)
      <br>
      Diogo (his hate on seamus may differ)
      <br>
      ItzChris/Ziggymoncher/InspectElement (an really old admin of BWR who betrayed us for the dumbest reasons, while also being the guy who made heyjoeway abandon his own community)
      <br>
      Jy (only when manipulated by a malicious user)
      <br>
      DanielTR52 (He will harass anyone in this server)
      <br>
      Moon Man (a extremely edgy motherfucker that impersonates people and likes to pretend he's not moon man. He impersonates people from the README, people who are admins, celebrities and some random memes, he does it so much that he likes to pretend to be them and act like a disgusting lolicon from Twitter.)
      <br>
      Charles Stansell (might have kicked the ball of the repl bonziworld widespread incident, where kiddies make their poorly made bw servers and do random shit with it. he also started exposing people's personal info again so that's another reason why he's on this list)
      <br>
      some minor enemies (that includes the entire kiddie base)
      <br>
      <strike>Skooli</strike>
<!--       im sure he is... maybe? -->
      <br>
      Poorly made BonziWORLD servers (one example is TheBonziWORLD's BonziWORLD Vanilla)
