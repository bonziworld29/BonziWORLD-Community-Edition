	  <h3>Type 3</h3>
      Fune 360 - The british teenager responsible for bonzi.lol. His dad has rumors about potentially being a criminal, and has caused mayhem in this community. He is the one responsible for the grooming rumors of Seamus involving his friends and other famous people, including Losky. The rumors caused a huge downgrade in this community and turned it into literally unplayable mess without getting your IP grabbed by their admin tools in their site and satirical colors that contain stereotypical discrimination about Jewish people or Arabs. He is no longer a huge threat to this site due to ongoing regional restrictions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Diogo - A teenager who has the most disgusting interests and traits. He is an major target of trolling and hate, but is also an OG of BonziWORLD. (I'm the man responsible for his appearance in this god awful site.)
      <br>
      <br>
      ItzChris/Ziggymoncher/InspectElement - An OG of BWR. He was a former cool-guy i used to like until he wasn't happy about how i was friends with Ardakirac and his gang (correct me if im wrong), along with issues with my behavior, disabilities and other things i forgot. He is also the mastermind of the BonzIWORLD ED Article, who has also moved on from ED and migrated to Fune's slow MediaWiki sub domain.
      <br>
      <br>
      Jy - Guy who is an neo-confederate, and way more bipolar than Seamus. Every apology from him is just bait at this point, because you will know he will come back to the 'kewl guys' servers and start rumbling about us again. He is massively into Weed and used his weed pen 2 times.

	  <strong>No matter what that narcissistic poorly photoshopped bonzi recolor says, This part of the page will stay forever. I don't care if i'm 'insensitive'.</strong>
	  <h3>Type 2</h3>
      <br>
      DanielTR52 - A colombian 15 year old kid with no mercy. Nothing stops him from harassing you and me. He is the manchild behind the pedo 'allegations' which many of them are just him being pissed over this site's existence and my interests in general. He faked being transgender and is now a huge racist and a transphobe.
      <br>
      Moon Man - This person is generally annoying to deal with in general, He can also say racial slurs and stuff about Nawtsees for his own pleasure. It's best you mute him for eternity and move on. This person won't be seen often because he can't access this site anymore because his VPN got banned from accessing this site.
      <br>
      Charles Stansell (Impostor) - This guy leaks your personal info found on the internet. Also known as Charles Stansell UTTP

	  <h3>Type 1</h3>
      <h4>some minor enemies (that includes the entire kiddie base)</h4>
      <strike>Skooli</strike>
		<!--im sure he is... maybe? -->
      <br>
      Poorly made BonziWORLD servers (one example is TheBonziWORLD's BonziWORLD Vanilla)
